# Go-Fish Game Application

A mobile game influenced by games like Fruit Ninja.  I wanted to make a sample application developed with Phaser and the Ionic frameworks.

## Features
* Multiple levels
* Game hi-score tracking
* Simple animations
* Rewards system


## Getting Started

Clone the repo and run npm install.  Type ionic serve to run the app in a browser.  Checkout the app through this link [Go Fish!](https://msalas74.github.io/go_fish/www/index.html#/)


## Built With

* Ionic - For the UI stuff
* Vanilla JS - For the good stuff
* Gulp - To automate my build and stuff
* NodeJS - For the server side stuff
* NPM - To install all the dependencies...and stuff
* Sublime Text - Where it's all put together!
* Code Style - [![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)


## TODO List

* Initial game mechanics
* Add Test (Jasmine, Karma, & angular-mocks)
* Incorporate Phaser Framework
* Simple art assets
* UI/UX design
* Intro/Instructions screen
